## Frequently Asked Questions

__Iâ€™m not a member of an underrepresented group, can I apply?__

We will likely not consider you in our selection process.

__What does the scholarship entail?__

If you get selected for a scholarship, you will receive a full ticket to JSConf EU and CSSconf EU. Additionally, we will pay for your flights/transport and/or accommodation.

__Can I apply for a scholarship again if I got one last year?__

We will not consider anyone who received a scholarship for JSConf EU/CSSconf EU in 2018, for the sake of fairness.

__How long are applications open for?__

This depends on whether you need a [_visa to enter Germany_](https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en/einreiseundaufenthalt/visabestimmungen-node). We have two separate timelines for people who need a visa and people who do not need a visa (i.e. Schengen area residents). The timelines are as follows:

- __If you need a visa__: From 15th of November, 2018 until 15th of January, 2019.
- __If you do not need a Visa__: From 15th of November, 2018 until 10th of March, 2019.
